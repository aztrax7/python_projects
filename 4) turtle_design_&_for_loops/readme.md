# 🐢 Turtle Design & Loop Operations

This project is a mix of **Turtle graphics design** and **loop-based Python programs**. It combines creative visual designs with practical logic exercises, making it perfect for learning nested loops, ranges, and Python's `turtle` graphics module.


## 📌 Features

### ✔️ Programs included:

- **Turtle Circle with Squares and Dots**
   - Uses the `turtle` module to draw:
     - A circular path
     - Small squares on the perimeter
     - Dots at the end of each square

- **Nested Loop Pattern (Value of i and j)**
   - Prints a series of nested loops in the given format in the code.

- **Multiplication Tables from n to 10**
   - Accepts a starting number `n` and prints multiplication tables up to 10 for all numbers from `n` to 10.
