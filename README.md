# 🐍 python_projects

Welcome to my personal collection of Python projects!  
This repository is a learning archive where I apply and expand my Python knowledge by working on different mini-projects and challenges. I’ll be updating it regularly as I continue to explore new concepts.

## 🧠 Skills Covered

- Variables and data types
- Conditionals
- Loops (for and while)
- Functions
- Basic math logic
- Turtle graphics
- File operations (upcoming)
- Jupyter Notebooks

## 🚀 What's Next

I’m just getting started! This repo will grow with:

- More algorithmic challenges
- Projects using libraries like `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `pygame`
- Real-world utilities and mini-apps
- Data science and AI experiments (future roadmap)

## 🛠 How to Run

All the projects are written in Python and formatted as Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb`).  
You can open them locally using:

1. **Jupyter Notebook / JupyterLab**  
2. **VS Code** with the Jupyter extension  
3. **Google Colab** (just upload the notebook)
